JPA Defines the specification. It is an API.
	--How do you define entities?
	--How do you map attributes?
	--Who manages the entities?

Hibernate is one of the popular implementations of JPA

Using Hibernate directly would result in a lock-in to Hibernate

(Ex:- we add hibernate jars to our class path and implement JPA.)

--There are other JPA Implementations (TopLink, for example)
